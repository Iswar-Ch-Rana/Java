/**
 * Interview Tip
 * <p>
 * Common question:
 * <p>
 * Q: Can we use == to compare enums in Java?
 * <p>
 * ðŸ‘‰ Yes. Unlike normal objects, enums are guaranteed singletons, so == works perfectly and is the recommended way.
 * <p>
 * Q: Whatâ€™s the difference between == and .equals() with enums?
 * <p>
 * ðŸ‘‰ Both work the same, but == is preferred for enums.
